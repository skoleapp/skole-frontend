## Development Tips üöÄ

- No pull requests can be merged without CI first building and running `Dockerfile` against it. See the bottommost `CMD` in the `Dockerfile` for the full list of stuff it runs and validates.
  CI also verifies the code style, so there is no need to argue about formatting.
- The code style is based on [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) with a few exceptions.
- Use functional components for everything.
- ESLint will show a warning for all `any`-typings. Use `unknown`-type instead or ignore the line if you absolutely have to.
- Comment all type ignores with a statement describing the reason for the ignore.
- Try to keep the JSX readable. In this project, we have tried to split up the JSX so that it _almost_ never exceeds 4 levels of depth.
- Place all global constants in `constants.ts` file. If the constant is related to theming/styles, you can place it in `theme.ts`.
- Place all global helper functions in `helpers.ts` file.
- Place all global hooks in the `hooks` folder in a file with the same name as the hook.
- Use named imports/exports for everything except most Material UI components. Always re-export functions that are inside a folder from an `index.ts` file.
- Whenever you add a new folder in the `src` directory, add it as an absolute path in the `tsconfig.json` file.
- Whenever you add a new file/folder in the root directory, please document it in the "What's inside?" section.
- Make sure your backend branch is up-to-date when running the GraphQL code gen as it validates the queries and mutations against the backend schemas.
- Use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components instead of native HTML elements for consistency, e.g. [Box](https://material-ui.com/components/box/#box) vs `div` and [Typography](https://material-ui.com/components/typography/#typography) vs. `p`-tags.
- Use React Context API for all app-level state management. Use the `context`-folder as a reference. In short, we avoid using reducers for less boilerplate. Place the context provider as low as possible in the component tree.
- If an interface/type is used in more than one place, put it in the `types` folder in a suitable file. If the interface/type is only used in one place, you may define it in that file.
- If you have only one component per file, name the component prop interface/type as `Props`. Otherwise, if you have two components in a file, e.g. `Foo` and `Bar`, name the prop interfaces/types as `FooProps` and `BarProps`.
- Avoid using inline styles. In this project, we have used [CSS in JS](https://v1.material-ui.com/customization/css-in-js/) nearly everywhere with a few exceptions.
- Document everything that is hard to understand from the code. Use single line comment syntax for everything, even for multi-line comments.
- Avoid writing event handlers/functions directly in JSX to keep it more readable.
- Use `React.FC` syntax for all components.
- Use [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/) for all icons. Make sure to use the outlined variants of the icons.
- Use `<></>` instead of `React.Fragment` for fragments.
- If you split up JSX to multiple variables, name them so that they start with the word "render", e.g `const renderFoo = ...`.
- TS doesn't play nice with React refs. Use non-null-assertions for refs, e.g. `const myRef = useRef(null!)`.
- Use ES6 syntax everywhere:
  - Avoid using the `function` keyword.
  - Use `async`/`await` syntax.
  - Destructure objects and imports whenever possible.
- Whenever you add a new page that Google should index, make sure to add that entry to the [`sitemap.xml.ts`](src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts) files `staticPaths` array.
- Whenever you add a new page that Google should not index, make sure to add that entry to the [`robots.txt.ts`](src/pages/robots.txt.ts) files `paths` array.
- Make sure not to update `@date-io/dayjs` beyond major version 1, later versions are currently not supported by MUI date pickers.
- For forms that use dynamic initial values, use the `enableReinitialize` prop together with the `useMemo` hook for the initial values.
- When settings `z-index` CSS values, document the use case so it's clear on which elements that value affects.
- Do not use `next/link`, use our custom `Link`-component instead to make sure anchor tags are always rendered properly.
- Generate Cypress fixtures easily by copying the request from `common.graphql` and using e.g. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to get the backend response as JSON.
