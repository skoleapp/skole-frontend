Our company values are built around privacy, transparency, openness and copyrights. We take every measure to enforce these principles in our software.

### Privacy

We take the privacy of our users very seriously. We protect the privacy of our users by collecting as little data as possible from our users and following general industry practices and modern security standards. We will never sell your data to anyone. If you wish to learn more about how we handle the privacy matters, please see our [privacy policy](https://www.skoleapp.com/privacy).

### Transparency

We want to be transparent on everything we do. This means communicating clearly to our users about things to consider when using Skole. If we say we won't spam you, we mean it.

### Openness

We enforce openness by making every feature and piece of content in Skole freely available for anyone. Anyone is free to join the community. We also hope our users to keep this mind.

### Copyrights

We respect copyrights of every piece of content on the platform. We take active measures to moderate the content in order to protect copyrights. We also proactively teach our users on what kind of content they are allowed to share.
