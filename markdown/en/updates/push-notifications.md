Our newest additions will make your experience of using Skole easier, faster and more rewarding! If you still haven't downloaded our app, now is the time to do it!

### Push Notifications ☁️ ➡️📱

Push notifications make your daily life easier, as you no longer have to manually check for responses to your messages, comments on your courses etc. You will now be notified about them automagically! Your push notification settings are enabled by default and you can adjust them according to your preferences in your [account settings](https://www.skoleapp.com/account-settings).

### Email Notifications 📧🔔

Just like push notifications, email notifications help you stay up-to-date on Skole. Email notifications allow you to receive notifications in your email on the events you like even without using our app.

### Tracking Badges 👀

Badges are rewards that you receive from completing certain tasks on Skole. You can now choose to track one badge at a time, easily seeing the progress as you go. We will be adding more badges constantly, so don't worry about them running out! 😅 You can learn more about the badges on our [badge page](https://www.skoleapp.com/badges).
