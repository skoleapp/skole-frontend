We've recently made some hefty changes in both the appearance and the functionality of Skole. We've aimed to make the discussions less spread out, making them easier to find, and making it faster to navigate back and forth between different discussions. Now you can find more things to chat about faster than ever!

### Dark Mode üï∂Ô∏è

You can now use Skole in dark mode like all other cool kids on the block. The dark mode will be automatically applied if you're already using one on your device. Your theme preference will also be saved on the device you use Skole with.

### School Discussions üí¨

Skole now supports schools wide discussions. You can chat with anyone on your school or hop into discussions of other schools. If you've added your school in your account settings, you can easily find the discussion for your school from the [home page](https://www.skoleapp.com/home). All schools have their own discussion, so e.g. the discussion for [University of Turku](https://www.skoleapp.com/schools/university-of-turku) would be a good place for posting any random questions that people going to UTU might be able to answer.

### Including Messages in Multiple Discussions ‚úâÔ∏è

As we tried to make the messages on Skole easier to find, we added a feature for including your messages on up to two discussions. If you post a message to a material discussion, you can include it in the corresponding course discussion as well. Similarly, if you post a message to a course discussion, you can include the message in the school discussion as well to get a larger audience for it. You can also easily see the discussions in which comments have been cross-posted from the comments themselves!

### Quick Add Comments ‚è©

We wanted to make the process of sharing one's thoughts easier, thus we added a feature for posting a comment quickly on your favorite discussions. You can find it from the [home page](https://www.skoleapp.com/home).

Quite cool stuff, huh? Like always, we are eager to hear what you think about these features and Skole in general. Stay tuned!
