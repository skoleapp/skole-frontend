Trending content, improved discussion, see your comments in your profile and much more! We decided to completely re-implement the frontend part for our discussion system. We transitioned from Jodel-like system, where the top-level and reply comment threads were separated, to a Reddit-like implementation. Now one is able to see all comments of courses and resources instantly. No more opening up threads!

### Trending Content 🔥

We added a feature for showing trending content, including courses, resources and comments. You can have your content included there too by by adding comments, creating courses, or uploading recources. Make sure they're good though, our AI-powered algorithm is quite picky on the content it selects 😉

### Improved Performance for Comments ⚡

We added an infinite scroll feature to make the experience of browsing the comments more performant. This is achieved by showing only a set of comments at any given time. Same old comments, new faster experience!

### Thumbnails for Attachments 🖼️

We finally added thumbnails on our comment attachments. Now you can instantly see a preview of the comment attachments and open up the full screen viewer by clicking the thumbnail. How convenient!

### Comments in Profile 💬

Just like we show the courses and resources our users create in their profiles, we did the same for their comments. Thats right, you can now see the comments made by anyone by visiting their profile!
