Over a year ago, four Computer Engineering students at the University of Turku had an idea to build something useful for themselves and their peers. That's how the story of Skole got started. The time has come for the mere idea to bear fruit for all of our student colleagues!

### What's it all About?

Skole is an app, a community and a space for students to share their thoughts and make their studying more effective. The anonymous discussions make it easy for anyone to come forward thoughts, allowing social interaction for anyone, which we recognize especially important during this remote studying mode.

The discussions are the main thing we encourage our users to have while using Skole. In addition, we have made it easy for one to view shared materials such as notes, exams, essays etc. Those functionalities exist to solve the problems with current solutions that students use; the discussions are often lost after a while when using traditional messaging apps. On Skole, one can always return to view the discussions as they are specific to courses and study materials. Another issue that Skole is made to solve is the restricted access of most online archives for study materials. Those archives also lack the possibility of an anonymous discussion. On Skole, everything is open and and available for discussion!

### Our Mission

Our mission is to make studying more transparent and improve the co-learning capabilities overall for all students around the world. We want to break the barriers between inside groups that we recognize existing within the student communities. By having all members of the student communities on the same starting line, we thrive to make the learning experience fairer.

### Packing it all in a Mobile App

Since we fist launched Skole a few weeks back, our app has been available only as a website. However, we know that students love apps! That's why we have released Skole in the [Apple App Store](APP_STORE_LINKKI) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skole) store. The app is free, contains no ads and requires no registration!

We hope that you enjoy using Skole!
