As soon as the university starts its studies, it is worth joining the student association. In this blog post I'm going to go through the reasons why to join the student association. Although student association activities are voluntary work and do not derive financial benefits, the benefits gained through them are nonetheless valuable. 
I'm going to go through the things that I think are valuable things, of which I have personally benefited from the activities of the student association.


### 1. Social network

Networking has begun to take shape, even as a cliché, but I think it’s something that you will only see the benefits of later in life. 
In the future, your fellow students can bring you a good friendship as well as a job, a business partner or an opportunity for something you can’t even imagine. So being active in student communities is actually more than just having fun together. Also what I personally saw really useful was being able to ask help with my studies for anyone in the student association and I always got help. 


### 2. Valuable skills and advices

Student associations organize a wide variety of events that can be very large. Organizing events is a great opportunity to learn skills that will be useful in the future as well. Organizing skills, leadership, budgeting or even collaboration are all skills that you can learn and are also useful in working life. Not to mention the advice and skills you can learn from others who you are working with. For example, maintaining or developing an association website is a really good opportunity to learn new things about a real project. For example my student association has a programming club that organizes various code-themed events from which you can learn a lot of new things. I think that is a great way to learn and get to know other people in the industry.

### 3. Opportunity to influence

Being part of different student organizations gives you also a great chance to change things. If anything in your studies needs improvement don't be afraid to make a move and influence on things. I know some of the people who liked working as part of a student association have made their career from it. So student activities should not be underestimated or considered unnecessary work, even if you may not be paid for it right away. 

#### Sum up

In summary, I would say that feel free to accept the association work whether they are big or small. I’ve certainly not gone through all the good things and not all work is necessarily nice, but it’s not worth underestimating the benefits you get from it. Your new job may be the result of good work you do. Who knows?
