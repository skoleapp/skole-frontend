After selecting a major and getting into a university, probably the second
big decision that a student faces during their studies is choosing a minor
subject. A minor subject (or subjects) is studied in university to complement
the student's major and to give a more balanced set of knowledge. Generally a
different minor is chosen for the bachelor's and master's degrees. Choosing a
minor can be a hard decision, and since the choice is a very personal one, there
isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for it. Nevertheless, this blog attempts to
give some tips for the process, which could turn out to be helpful.

### 1. Gather Your Options

Like every important decision, this one also should start with getting all the
available information first. Before choosing anything, one should know what
minor subjects are available for them. Whatever you do, don't just blindly
choose something before seeing all the options, you can never know what
interesting choices exist if you don't do some research first. The available subjects
can depend a lot based on the university and the major that one is studying,
but the university's study guide should be the place to look at. Don't just
rely on hearsay or the fact that you think that you know all available choices
already. Most likely there are a quite a few options that you weren't initially
aware of.

### 2. Limit the Amount of Choices

A good way to make a hard decision easier, is to limit the amount of options to
choose from. Go over the list of all available subjects and remove every choice
from it that you are confident you absolutely do not want to study. In the off
chance that that resulted in a single subject that was left over ‚Äî good, the process was
easy, and you can quit reading now. If instead you turned down every option since
nothing interests you, try to start over and be a little less critical üòÅ

### 3. Think About the Good Stuff

#### Think What Interests You

Like your major subject, your minor should ideally actually interest you. If
you don't have any passion for the subject doing course work on it will be
miserable, and most likely you don't want to utilize any of the stuff you've
learned in the future. Try to pick a subject that you would actually want to
learn a lot more from, and the courses will be a breeze.

#### Think About Your Dream Job

One of the biggest selling points of going into a university in the first place
is to eventually get a good career. Think about what you want to do in the
future and choose a minor that can shed some light on that field. I chose data
analytics as the minor for my master's degree, since I though machine learning
was cool, and I wanted to work with in the future. After studying a few courses
of it, data analytics turned out to be nothing like I imagined, and now I'm
super glad I tried it for the 20 credits and don't have to think about it as a
career choice ever again.

#### Think What Complements Your Other Subjects

Depending on your field and program, chances are you will be having one or two
major subjects throughout your university degree and one to maybe four minor
subjects. That can be a lot to try to puzzle together, but in any case it pays
to at least swiftly think about at least your major subject and what would
complement them nicely. Chances are that there are at least some immediate
obvious candidates for minor subjects that would strengthen your overall
expertise in your field of choice. If you're now choosing a minor for your
bachelor's degree and are set to also do a master's, it also helps to give some
thought to your master's degree's major subject and the potential minor(s) that
you'll be picking later. It can get overwhelming easily, but some planning for
the future is always smart.

### 4. Ask Around

Before locking down your decision, a good final strategy is to ask some older
students you know, who have studied the minor, and get them to tell you
how it was like. Even though you should not choose your minor based on what
others have chosen, nothing beats first-hand experience and hearing about the
practicalities of the subject's courses can help clarify the decision and allow
you to get a last confirmation whether a particular subject is the one for you.

Hopefully this helps you at least partly with the tough decision. As always
