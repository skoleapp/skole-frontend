This is a registry and privacy policy in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Last updated on 2020-12-12.

### 1. General

We hold the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard, and we do not collect or process any information about you that is not necessary for the operation of the service. This privacy policy contains information about what personal information we collect, how we process it, and what rights and opportunities you have over your information.

The Skole application and Skole Oy process personal information about you in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law, so we ask that you read this privacy policy carefully. When you use our services, our website or contact us, your personal data is processed in accordance with this privacy policy.

### 2. For what purpose is my personal data collected and processed?

We collect, store and process personal information about you only for pre-defined purposes. Uses include:

- Fulfillment of legal obligations and requirements
- Ensuring the security of the service
- Customer communication and answering contact requests
- Improving the usability of the service, e.g showing personalized content
- Prevention of abuse and harassment

### 3. What personal information about me is collected and from what sources?

We collect personal information about you directly from you or you device when you use our service or contact us.

When you register an account we collect and process your:

- Username
- Email
- Registration time
- Password in an irreversibly hashed form

The above information must be provided in order for us to provide the service to you. You are not legally obligated to provide the information, but in that case you will not be able to use our service.

When you use the service with a registered account we collect and process your:

- Actions that you do in the application and timestamps of them. This includes for example the comments you have made and the material you have uploaded.
- Optional additional information that you have added to your user profile, such as an avatar, a title, a bio, your school, and your subject.

In addition, some basic request information (e.g. IP-addresses, access times, and user agents) might be collected by us or our hosting provider.

We also use third party analytics tools to collect visitor data from the application so that we can improve it. The data collected by them contains aggregate information from for example the number of visitors and the number of page views, and none of it can be connected to any individual users.

### 4. On what basis is personal data processed?

We make sure that we always have a legal basis for processing your personal information. We process your personal information to provide our service to you, improve our service and to manage the customer relationship between us and you as the user of our service. The legal basis for such processing is the performance of our mutual agreement (art. 6 1. b of the GDPR).

### 5. Who processes my data and is it passed on to third parties?

Your personal data is processed by persons belonging to our company's personnel in the performance of their duties. In this case, we take care, among other things, by agreements that the confidentiality of your information is maintained, and that the information is processed in a lawful manner.

We may disclose your information to our contractual partners and/or subcontractors when it is necessary in order to provide our service. These partners include our hosting provider ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)), email ([Google](https://www.google.com)) and image processing ([Cloudmersive](https://cloudmersive.com)) services. In these situations, we will take the necessary steps to protect your information, e.g. by signing appropriate data processing agreements with the processors.

To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com). This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not about individuals per say, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information. [Go to their documentation](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect) to find out what Simple Analytics collects (and most importantly what they don't).

We may also disclose your information to third parties or relevant authorities when required by law or by a competent authority, and to relevant third parties in connection of a planned share or business acquisition or sale.

### 6. Will my data be disclosed outside the EU?

Your data wont generally be transferred or processed outside of the EU/EEA. However, there are situations where our partner or subcontractor used for providing the service, either resides or needs to transfer information outside of the EU/EEA. These partners or subcontractors may process personal data when providing, for example, IT- or hosting services. In these cases, sufficient data protection is ensured by using approved transfer mechanisms, such as signing EU Commission’s standard contractual clauses in connection with the transfer.

### 7. How long will my personal information be kept?

Your information will be kept for as long as you have an account registered with us. If you wish to delete your information, you can delete your account at any time, and we will immediately automatically delete all your account information and anonymize all actions you have made in the application. We will also automatically do this for all user accounts that have not logged in to the service for two years.

### 8. How is my information stored and protected?

Your information is stored on servers of the service providers described in section 5. The servers are protected in accordance with general industry practices and modern standards. The data and disclosing or transfer of the data is handled in accordance with sections 5 and 6 of this privacy policy.

### 9. What are cookies used for in the application?

We use cookies in the application to provide the best possible user experience. Cookies are short text files that a web server stores on the user’s device. Cookies allow us to authenticate you and to identify you between different visits. We also use cookies to improve security.
