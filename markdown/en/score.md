The most important activities on Skole are adding comments, courses and materials called resources. Certain amount of points are not needed for any of these activities so they are available for anyone.

Your score in Skole is a rough measurement of how much the other students trust your and like your content. Points are earned by gaining upvotes on from courses, resources and comments. The higher your score is, the more other users trust you and the content you upload. By increasing your score you will gain certain privileges such as badges that are given only for users with high enough score.

### How do I increase my score?

The primary way to increase your score is to post good questions and useful answers. Votes on these comments cause you to gain (or sometimes lose) points.

### You gain points when:

- Your resource is voted up: +10
- Your course is voted up: +5
- Your comment is voted up: +1

### You lose points when:

- Your resource is voted down: −10
- Your course is voted down: −5
- Your comment is voted down: −1

### What if I delete things?

Deleting content that has either upvotes or downvotes won't affect your score.
