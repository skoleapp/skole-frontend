Your score in Skole is a rough measurement of how much the other students trust your and like your content. Points are earned by gaining upvotes on from threads and comments. The higher your score is, the more other users trust you and the content you share. By increasing your score you will gain certain privileges such as badges that are given only for users with high enough score.

### How do I increase my score? 🤔

The primary way to increase your score is to share useful content. Votes on your content cause you to gain (or sometimes lose) points.

### You gain points when:

- Your thread is voted up: +20
- Your comment is voted up: +10

### You lose points when:

- Your thread is voted down: −20
- Your comment is voted down: −10

### Rank 🎖️

Your rank is a visualization for your score. Your rank will be calculated based on the following:

| Score     | Rank      |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0-100     | Freshman  |
| 100-250   | Tutor     |
| 250-500   | Mentor    |
| 500-1000  | Bachelor  |
| 1000-2000 | Master    |
| 2000-5000 | Doctor    |
| 5000+     | Professor |

### What if I delete things? 🧐

Deleting content that has either upvotes or downvotes won't affect your score.
